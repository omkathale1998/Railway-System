## 🗂️ Database Structure

- *Database Name*: railway_system
- *Main Table*: Reservation
- *Total Rows*: 15 reservations
- *Added Columns*: km, Age
- *Key Features*:
  - Passenger, Train & Booking Details
  - Travel Duration and Distance
  - Payment, Status, and Meal Info
---

## 📌 Key Features

- 🧾 *Practical reservation dataset* with 15 realistic entries
- 🔁 Use of ALTER TABLE and UPDATE to simulate real-world data evolution
- 📊 Strong use of aggregate functions:
  - AVG, COUNT, MAX, MIN
- ⚙️ Demonstrates conditional logic:
  - CASE, HAVING, EXISTS, IN, ANY, BETWEEN
- 📋 Grouped reports, filters, and searches using GROUP BY, LIKE, and DISTINCT
- 🔍 Query types range from basic retrieval to advanced filtering and revenue analysis

---
## 📊 Types of SQL Queries

- *Insert* new id and member records
- *Update* a member's address
- *Delete* issued records
- *Joins* and *aggregations* for reporting
- *CTAS*: Create tables with derived data
- *Date filtering*: Recent registrations
---

## 📌 Insights & Learnings

✅ Used CASE for conditional logic (age-based discounts/insurance)  
✅ Applied *subqueries* for deep filtering (IN, EXISTS, ANY)  
✅ Mastered GROUP BY and HAVING for grouped analytics  
✅ Used aggregation functions: SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX  
✅ Implemented *pattern matching* with LIKE, BETWEEN for flexible filtering

## 📈 Conclusion

This project successfully simulates a *realistic railway reservation system*. It includes everything from schema creation and data population to complex querying and analytical insight.

### Key Takeaways:
- Understand booking trends and passenger behavior
- Measure revenue generated per train and per route
- Classify passengers by age-based criteria (for discounts/insurance)
- Analyze journey distances and durations
- Perform filtering based on:
  - Meal preferences  
  - Booking status  
  - Payment modes  
  - Age groups  
  - Cities and states
